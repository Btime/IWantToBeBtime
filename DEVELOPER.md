# Developer's Manual

## What does developer do?

Development goes far beyond simply programming, it encompasses knowledge of architecture, communication, management and business. It is the responsibility of the developer to guarantee the operation and maintenance of the System as a whole, called DevOps. You do not need to be an expert in these areas, but basic knowledge is welcome.

The Developer is always renewing itself and evolving. It maintains a spirit of leadership that motivates everyone around you.

## What is DevOps?

DevOps is the alignment of the development team with the operations team, in relation to processes, tools and responsibilities, aiming to accelerate deliveries in production with a high degree of quality.

## How does agile development work?

We use the **Agile Scrum** methodology, with biweekly **Sprints**:

- **Planning:** We present an overview of the Sprint development team, showing all activities, which should be performed during that period. The team sets the necessary hours in activity and who will execute it. This planning will last around 2 hours, and will be at the end of the day at 4:00 p.m.
- **Development:** Sprint's longest duration, lasting approximately 9 days. Starting on Monday at 9 o'clock, ending on the Thursday of the week after 6 o'clock. During this time each developer must manage the status of their tasks between our delivery workflow.
- **Daily:** Every day before starting, the developer will check your Tasks at Jira and what will be done by him during the day will be in "To Do", at 10 o'clock we will share quickly what was done in the day previous, what will be done in the day and if there is any difficulty.
- **Code Review:** Will be done during the last day, starting at 9 o'clock and going until 4 o'clock the same day. One developer will review the other's code, and in the end will go through the CTO sieve.
